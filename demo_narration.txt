[0–10s] This is ULA Solana Agent Forge — the first fully autonomous meta-agent that builds, deploys, and evolves entire Solana ecosystems with zero human code.

[10–30s] Watch: AGI decides a high-value DeFi arbitrage agent idea using Solana’s low fees and high speed.

[30–50s] Step 2: It generates a ULA specification, then compiles it into a native Solana Rust program — fully autonomous, no manual coding.

[50–70s] Step 3: The agent deploys it to Solana devnet. Here’s the live program ID and transaction signature — verifiable on-chain right now.

[70–85s] Step 4: It monitors performance, evolves itself, and starts the next agent. This is recursive autonomy on Solana — the future of on-chain AI.

[85–90s] ULA Agent Forge — showing the world that the future is already here. Submitted to Solana Radar Agent Hackathon.
